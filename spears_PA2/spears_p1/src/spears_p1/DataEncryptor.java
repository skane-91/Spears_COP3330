 * read a four-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt 
 * it as follows: Replace each digit with the result of adding 
 * 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the 
 * new value by 10. Then swap the first digit with the third, 
 * and swap the second digit with the fourth. Then print the 
 * encrypted integer.
