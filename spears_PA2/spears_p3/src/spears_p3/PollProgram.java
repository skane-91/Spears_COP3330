 * Write a simple polling program that allows users to 
 * rate five topics from 1 (least important) to 10 (most 
 * important). Pick five topics that are important to 
 * you (e.g., political issues, global environmental 
 * issues, food, video games). Use a one-dimensional 
 * array topics (of type String) to store the five issues. 
 * To summarize the survey responses, use a 5-row, 
 * 10-column two-dimensional array responses (of type int), 
 * each row corresponding to an element in the topics array. 
 * When the program runs, it should ask the user to rate each 
 * issue. Multiple people should be able to respond to the 
 * survey during a single run of the program. Once all 
 * responses have been logged, have the program display a 
 * summary of the results...
